# TODO:
An implementation subclassing [tfp.distributions.Distribution](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/Distribution). See also 
[this notebook](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/main/tensorflow_probability/examples/jupyter_notebooks/Understanding_TensorFlow_Distributions_Shapes.ipynb) and the implementation of the [logistic distribution](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/v0.16.0/tensorflow_probability/python/distributions/logistic.py#L33-L236).
